## Ensemble Machine Learning Models



Ensemble models in machine learning operate on a similar idea. They combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. 

Ensemble methods are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results. Ensemble methods usually produces more accurate solutions than a single model would. This has been the case in a number of machine learning competitions, where the winning solutions used ensemble methods.
