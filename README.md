## Ensemble Machine Learning Models



Ensemble models in machine learning operate on a similar idea. They combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. 


Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach allows the production of better predictive performance compared to a single model. That is why ensemble methods placed first in many prestigious machine learning competitions, such as the Netflix Competition, KDD 2009, and Kaggle.



**Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking).**

Ensemble methods are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results. Ensemble methods usually produces more accurate solutions than a single model would. This has been the case in a number of machine learning competitions, where the winning solutions used ensemble methods.
